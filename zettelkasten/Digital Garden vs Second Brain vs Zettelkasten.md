# Digital Garden vs Second Brain vs Zettelkasten

After some research, it seems that all those nominations given by people to their own personal knowledge management systems end up being just a matter of prefference, it all means basically the same: a place where you store/develop your own ideas in an efficient way.

Important: Zettelkasten here doesn't refers specifically to Luhmann's Zettelkasten, just to the way some/may call their personal knowledge place
