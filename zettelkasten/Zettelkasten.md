# Zettelkasten

The Zettelkasten is a note-taking method in which each note has an ID and represents an independent idea, the notes are interlinked using their IDs to form relationships between then. It isn't just a bunch of ideas in a box, the links that are created together with the notes end up into conglomerates of related stuff. The result is a "natural" web of knowledge that reflects well the way your mind understands those pieces of knowledge and can/will be valueable to others with similar personality/level of experience.
