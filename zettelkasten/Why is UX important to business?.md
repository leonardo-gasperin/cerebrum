# Why is UX important to business?

Regardless of the [Product](Product.md), business that focus on usability and design generally do better than the ones that doesn't. 

The way it happens is like this:

1. User uses [Product](Product.md)
2. User likes [Product](Product.md)
3. User tells good things about the [Product](Product.md) to other people

Another plus is that because of the simplistic way the human views are influenced, this isn't only good for the [Product](Product.md) reputation but for the business too, after all someone who provides good things is good too, right?
